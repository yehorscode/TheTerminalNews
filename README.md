A site that uses NYT's RSS feed to display short snippets of news with a cool twist. It's haxxor style

## Extra cool demo!!!!
https://the-terminal-news.vercel.app/ !!
NOTE: WARNING: PLEASE LOOK: if no one opened it in a while it may take up to 40 SECONDS TO START THE API PLEASE BE PATIENT

### How to run (locally)
if you are a schizo and you are paranoid please run this:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yehorscode/TheTerminalNews TheTerminal && cd TheTerminal && echo installed the repo now installing dependencies && npm i && echo running site && npm run dev
```

### Is this legal?
Yes its legal to make rss feeds look cool a lot of apps do this

### Trouble shooting:
If the rss feed doesnt load, please wait a bit, maybe render.com needs to load the api
